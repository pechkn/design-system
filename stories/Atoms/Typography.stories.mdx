# Typography

## Font

### Typeface

Don't use monospaced typefaces for text which is not a number, math equation or part of code
Do use sans-serif font for body text
Because monospaced text is harder to read

Don't rely solely on the appearance when choosing font type
Do look for typefaces that Support Multiple Languages even if UI is targeted on one-language audience
Because UI can be translated on other languages by users themselves or can become multilingual in the future

Don't overuse decorative fonts
Do keep classic serif or sans serif font in the majority of UI
Because decorations worsen accessibiity

### Size

Don't use fontsizes smaller than 16px
Do use 16px and larger font
Because small font-size is often barely readable and not every UI supports increasing text size

### Height

### Length

Don't make lines of text longer than 80 (640px) or shorter than 40 (320px) characters
Do stick to 55-75 characters per line
Because too short or too long text is harder to read

### Width

Don't use condensed or thin typefaces, especially for applications that may be used in distracting environments (such as GPS navigation)
Do use normal width or wide fonts for any text that is meant to be read, not just be noticed
Because condensed font is harder to notice and read

### Case

Don't use all-caps text for heading, buttons, body text etc
Do use all-caps for glanceable text, such as time or main app on-screen statistic
Because all-caps is harder to read and it takes attention from surrounding text

Don't use all-lowercase text for headings, buttons, sentences etc for the minimalistic looks' sake
Do use normal case for any text that is meant to be read, not just be noticed
Beacse all-lowercase is harder to notice and read

### Weight

Don't
Do use contrasting font weights to distinguish parts of content

## Heading

## Link

### Label

Don't make links consisting of 1-2 words like "click here"
Do meaningful long link labels
Because users want to clearly know where they will be taken if they click on link

### Placement

Don't put links in the text
Do put a list of links from the page at the end so that the user goes to them after reading the page
Because user might be distracted from the main text and won't finish reading the page

### Color

Don't use color only to distinguish link from text
Do underline in-text links
Because colorblind users won't notice colored out link

### Underline

Don't underline any text that's not a link
Do reserve underlining for links
Because underlines provide a strong perceived affordance of clickability, users will be confused and disappointed if underlined text doesn't have an actual affordance to match this perception
